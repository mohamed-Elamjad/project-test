The two JavaScript functions share a similar purpose—calculating a quiz score—but they differ in structure, input handling, and logic. Here’s a breakdown of the differences:
---
### 1. Score Calculation Function
#### Key Features**- **Inputs: 
  - questions array containing details of each question (e.g., correct answers).  - answers array representing the user's selected answers.
- Logic:   - Iterates through each question using .forEach().
  - Compares the user's answers (`userAnswer`) to the correct answers (`question.correct`).  - Awards +2 points for fully correct answers.
  - Deducts -1 point if the user's answers are incorrect or partially correct.- Return: 
  - Returns the final score (`score`) after processing all questions.  
#### **Advantages**- Works well for dynamic or complex question data stored in objects or arrays.
- Can handle questions with multiple correct answers.
---
### 2. Submit and Calculate Quiz Results
#### Key Features**- **Inputs: 
  - totalQuestions defines the number of questions.  - Answers are retrieved from the DOM (`input[name="q${i}"]`).
- Logic:   - Uses a for loop to iterate through each question by its index (`i`).
  - Retrieves the selected answers from radio/checkbox inputs using document.querySelectorAll.  - Awards:
    - +2 points for fully correct answers (exact match).    - -1 point for partially correct answers or incorrect selections (e.g., selecting "3").
- Output:   - Alerts the user with the final score using alert().
#### Advantages
- Suitable for quizzes with HTML input fields (radio buttons or checkboxes).- Handles the DOM directly, making it simpler for static web pages.

### Key Differences
| Aspect           | Score Calculation Function                           | Submit Quiz Results                             |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|| Input Source      | Works with data stored in questions and answers arrays. | Retrieves answers directly from HTML input elements. |
| Iteration         | Uses .forEach() on the questions array.              | Uses a for loop for iterating over question indexes. || Comparison Logic  | Compares array lengths and matches all answers exactly.  | Checks selected values for specific conditions (e.g., "1" or "2"). |
| Output            | Returns the score for further processing.                | Displays the score immediately via alert().      || Flexibility       | More flexible for dynamic quiz data structures.          | Tightly coupled to the DOM structure of the page.  |

### Use Cases
- Use Score Calculation Function if:  - The quiz data is dynamic and stored as arrays or objects.
  - You need a reusable scoring function that doesn’t depend on the DOM.
- Use Submit Quiz Results if:  - The quiz is implemented directly with HTML inputs.
  - Simplicity and direct DOM handling are priorities.
